# Question: How do you find the longest increasing subsequence in an array? JavaScript Summary

The JavaScript function `longestIncreasingSubsequence` is designed to find the longest increasing subsequence in an array. It uses dynamic programming to solve this problem. The function begins by checking if the array is empty, returning 0 if it is. It then creates a new array `dp` of the same length as the input array, filling it with 1s. This `dp` array is used to store the length of the longest increasing subsequence ending at each index in the input array. The function then iterates over the input array, and for each element, it checks all previous elements. If a previous element is smaller than the current element, the function updates the `dp` value for the current element to be the maximum of its current value and the `dp` value of the smaller element plus one. This effectively extends the longest increasing subsequence up to the smaller element to include the current element. The function keeps track of the maximum `dp` value found, which represents the length of the longest increasing subsequence in the array. This maximum value is returned as the result.

# TypeScript Differences

The TypeScript version of the solution is more complex than the JavaScript version. It uses a class-based approach and introduces additional arrays `tailIndexes` and `prevIndices` to keep track of the indices of the smallest tail elements and the previous indices of the longest increasing subsequences respectively. 

The TypeScript version also uses binary search to find the position of the current element in the `tailIndexes` array, which makes it more efficient than the JavaScript version for large input arrays. 

In terms of language features, the TypeScript version uses static methods and type annotations, which are not available in JavaScript. The type annotations help to ensure that the correct types of values are used throughout the code, reducing the likelihood of runtime errors.

The TypeScript version also returns the actual longest increasing subsequence, not just its length. This is a significant difference in functionality compared to the JavaScript version. 

In summary, the TypeScript version is more complex and efficient, uses additional TypeScript language features, and provides more detailed output than the JavaScript version.

# C++ Differences

The C++ version of the solution uses the same dynamic programming approach as the JavaScript version. Both versions create a dynamic programming (dp) array to store the length of the longest increasing subsequence ending at each index. They then iterate over the input array, checking all previous elements that are smaller. If a smaller element is found, they update the dp value for the current element. The maximum value in the dp array is the length of the longest increasing subsequence.

The main differences between the two versions are due to the differences in the languages themselves:

1. Syntax: C++ uses a different syntax than JavaScript. For example, C++ uses `std::vector<int>` to declare an array of integers, while JavaScript uses `Array()`. C++ also uses `std::max` and `std::max_element` to find the maximum value, while JavaScript uses `Math.max`.

2. Libraries: The C++ version uses the `<algorithm>` library to use the `std::max` and `std::max_element` functions. JavaScript does not require any additional libraries to use `Math.max`.

3. Input/Output: The C++ version uses `std::cout` to output the result, while the JavaScript version uses `console.log`. The C++ version also uses a `main` function to run the code, while the JavaScript version does not.

4. Type Safety: C++ is a statically typed language, which means you have to declare the type of variables before you use them. JavaScript is dynamically typed, which means you don't have to declare the type of variables.

5. Memory Management: In C++, you have more control over memory management. This is not the case in JavaScript, where memory management is handled automatically by the garbage collector.
